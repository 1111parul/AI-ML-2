# 🏦 Bank Loan Approval Prediction  

**Welcome to the Bank Loan Approval Prediction Project!** 🌟  

The financial sector relies on data-driven decisions, especially when it comes to approving loans. This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether an applicant is likely to be approved for a loan based on factors such as credit score, income, employment status, and more. The goal is to automate the decision-making process, making it faster, more efficient, and fair.  

Using classification algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Neural Networks**, this project demonstrates how AI can enhance the financial lending process. Whether you’re interested in the future of banking, financial technologies, or machine learning in decision systems, this project offers valuable insights into the power of predictive modeling in the financial industry.  

**Step into the world of smarter banking with AI-powered loan approval predictions!** 🚀

## OVERVIEW: 
The main goal is to develop a model that predicts whether the customer's bank loan will be approved or rejected using deep learning. This will allow users to enter necessary details and receive predictions.

This is a deep learning problem where we use simple ANN to implement this and achieve higher accuracy.

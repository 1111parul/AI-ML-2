# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting  

**Welcome to the Weather Forecasting Project!** 🌟  

Accurate weather forecasting is essential for a wide range of industries, from agriculture to transportation. This project uses Machine Learning models to predict weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, based on historical weather data and other meteorological variables. By understanding patterns and trends in the data, the model aims to provide reliable short-term weather forecasts.  

Through the use of techniques like **Time Series Analysis** and **Classification Models**, this project shows how AI can enhance our ability to predict and plan for changing weather patterns. If you’re passionate about environmental science, AI, or data-driven predictions, this project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the intersection of weather and machine learning.  

**Be part of the future of weather prediction with AI-driven insights!** 🚀

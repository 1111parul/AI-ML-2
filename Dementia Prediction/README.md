## 🧠 Dementia Prediction  

**Welcome to the Dementia Prediction Project!** 🌟  

Dementia is a complex condition, and early diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of dementia in patients based on factors such as age, lifestyle, medical history, and neuroimaging data. By analyzing this data, the model aims to identify early signs of dementia, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals.  

Using algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM**, this project highlights how AI can assist in the healthcare industry, particularly in early detection and diagnosis. If you are passionate about healthcare AI, predictive modeling, or neuroinformatics, this project offers a meaningful and impactful exploration into the future of dementia prediction.  

**Be part of a project that leverages AI to transform healthcare and improve lives!** 🚀
